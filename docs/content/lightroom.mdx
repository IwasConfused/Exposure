### Chromatic Process
**Tinted Glass** placed on top of Lightroom will make it *Refracted*, which unlocks **Chromatic Process**.\
When toggled on (using the button on the left side), printing a frame will only print single channel at a time.\
Doing this will produce a Chromatic Sheet with **red** channel printed. Use the sheet as a paper to print rest of the channels.\
When last channel is printed (blue), Chromatic Sheet will be converted to a regular [Photograph](photograph).

<Callout>
    Chromatic Sheet always receives channels in order: red -> green -> blue, regardless of what frame is being printed.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="info">
    Frames taken with R/G/B filter will have the channel shown in tooltip. This is only for you to help you choose correct frame for proper result.

### Redstone:
- When the Lightroom Block receives a redstone pulse, it will start printing selected frame.
- After printing finishes - next frame will become selected.
    - After printing the last frame, the Lightroom will eject the film through the front. (this can be prevented by blocking the front side with a non-transparent block)
- This allows you to fully automate printing of Photographs.
