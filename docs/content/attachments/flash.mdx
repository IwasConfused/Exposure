*Example exposure with flash*
</div>

### Flash illuminates small area nearby

- can be toggled *on/off/auto*
    - if in *auto* mode - would only fire if light level at camera position is lower than 8
- there's not much to it, it's just a light in a small radius

<Callout>
    Flash places a light source at camera position (or close to it, if obstructed)
