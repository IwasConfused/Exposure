<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
<Asset location="exposure:filter" width={400} title="Pink Glass Pane as a filter" style={{ textAlign: "center" }}/>
*Filters use post effects (shaders) to alter the image*
</div>

You can use Glass Panes to tint the image with pane's color.\
Three of them are a bit special: Red, Green and Blue. These have stronger tint effect to enable [Chromatic Process](../lightroom#chromatic-process)

There is one unique filter: [<Asset location="exposure:interplanar_projector"/> Interplanar Projector](../interplanar_projector)

### You can also define [Custom Filters](../../datapacks/custom_filters)
